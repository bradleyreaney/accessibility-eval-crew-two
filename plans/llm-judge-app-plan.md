- **Cross-References**: Links to related components and dependencies

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Start with the [Master Plan](./master-plan.md)** for project overview
2. **Follow the phases sequentially** beginning with [Phase 1](./phase-1-foundation.md)
3. **Use cross-references** to understand component relationships
4. **Check quality gates** before proceeding to the next phase

## üìä Project Overview

This system implements an "LLM as a Judge" application using CrewAI to evaluate accessibility remediation plans. The system uses **Gemini Pro** and **GPT-4** as expert judges to provide comprehensive evaluations based on your existing sophisticated framework in `promt/eval-prompt.md`.

### Key Features
- **Multi-Judge Validation**: Cross-validation between Gemini and GPT-4
- **Existing Framework Integration**: Built on your established evaluation criteria
- **Automated Synthesis**: Generate optimal plans by combining best elements
- **Professional PDF Reports**: Executive summaries, detailed analyses, comparative reports
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple audit reports efficiently
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production deployment with monitoring and scaling

### Technology Stack
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent orchestration
- **Python 3.9+**: Core development
- **Streamlit**: User interface
- **LangChain**: LLM integration
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Sequential Implementation**: Phases should be completed in order due to dependencies
- **Quality Gates**: Each phase has completion criteria that must be met
- **Cross-References**: Use the links to understand component relationships
- **Existing Framework**: All implementation builds on your established `promt/eval-prompt.md`
