## Overview

Phase 3 integrates the individual agents developed in Phase 2 into a coordinated CrewAI workflow. This phase focuses on orchestrating the evaluation process, implementing task definitions, and creating the automated pipeline that manages the entire LLM as a Judge system from input to final synthesis.

## Prerequisites

- [x] **Phase 2 Complete**: All agents (Judge, Comparison, Synthesis) functional
- [x] **Agent Testing**: Individual agents tested and working correctly
- [x] **Tool Integration**: Custom tools properly integrated with agents
- [x] **Output Validation**: Agent outputs structured and parseable

## Objectives

- [x] **Task Definitions**: Create comprehensive task specifications for workflow
- [x] **Crew Configuration**: Implement coordinated multi-agent crew
- [x] **Workflow Orchestration**: Design and implement evaluation pipeline
- [x] **Quality Assurance**: Cross-validation and consensus mechanisms
- [x] **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery and retry logic
- [x] **Workflow Documentation**: Data flow diagrams, integration patterns, and performance guides
