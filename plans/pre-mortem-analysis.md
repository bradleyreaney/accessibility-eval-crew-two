# Pre-Mortem Analysis & Risk Assessment
*LLM as a Judge - Accessibility Remediation Plan Evaluator*

**← [Master Plan](./master-plan.md)** | **Cross-referenced from all phases**

## Executive Summary

This pre-mortem analysis identifies potential failure modes, risks, and challenges that could impact the success of the LLM as a Judge project. By analyzing these risks proactively, we can implement mitigation strategies before they become critical issues.

## Project Alignment Review

### ✅ Strengths Identified

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: All 5 phases are well-documented with clear dependencies
2. **Existing Framework Integration**: Strong alignment with `promt/eval-prompt.md` evaluation criteria
3. **TDD Methodology**: Solid testing strategy with 95% coverage target
4. **Quality Gates**: Enhanced quality assurance across security, performance, and reliability
5. **Professional Output**: Multiple PDF report types for different stakeholder needs
6. **Technology Stack**: Proven technologies (CrewAI, LangChain, Streamlit)
7. **Real Data**: 7 remediation plans (A-G) and audit reports ready for testing

### ⚠️ Potential Alignment Issues

1. **Documentation References**: Some cross-references point to non-existent files (e.g., `technical-specs.md`, `api-specs.md`)
2. **Scope Creep**: Phase 5 includes significant enterprise features that may extend timeline
3. **Resource Requirements**: No clear specification of team size or skill requirements

## Pre-Mortem Risk Analysis

### 🔴 High-Risk Scenarios

#### Risk 1: LLM API Reliability & Costs
**Scenario**: LLM APIs become unreliable, rate-limited, or cost-prohibitive during evaluation
**Probability**: Medium-High | **Impact**: High

**Potential Failure Modes**:
- Gemini Pro or GPT-4 API outages during critical evaluations
- Unexpected rate limiting with 7 plans requiring multiple judge calls
- Cost escalation with complex evaluation prompts consuming many tokens
- Model deprecation or breaking changes during development

**Mitigation Strategies**:
```python
# Implementation in Phase 1
class LLMFallbackManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary_llm = "gemini-pro"
        self.fallback_llms = ["gpt-4", "gpt-3.5-turbo", "claude-3"]
        self.rate_limiter = TokenBucketRateLimiter()
        self.cost_monitor = CostTracker()
    
    async def evaluate_with_fallback(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        for llm in [self.primary_llm] + self.fallback_llms:
            try:
                if self.rate_limiter.can_proceed(llm):
                    response = await self.call_llm(llm, prompt)
                    self.cost_monitor.track_usage(llm, response.token_count)
                    return response
            except (APIError, RateLimitError) as e:
                self.log_fallback(llm, e)
                continue
        raise LLMUnavailableError("All LLM services failed")
```

**Additional Mitigations**:
- [ ] Implement API key rotation for multiple accounts
- [ ] Cache evaluation results to avoid re-processing identical plans
- [ ] Create cost alerts when approaching budget thresholds
- [ ] Develop offline evaluation mode using local models as last resort

#### Risk 2: Evaluation Consistency & Judge Disagreement
**Scenario**: Primary and secondary judges produce wildly inconsistent scores
**Probability**: Medium | **Impact**: High

**Potential Failure Modes**:
- Gemini Pro and GPT-4 interpreting evaluation criteria differently
- Non-deterministic responses causing score variance >20% between runs
- Edge cases in remediation plans causing judge confusion
- Cultural or training data bias affecting accessibility evaluations

**Mitigation Strategies**:
```python
# Implementation in Phase 3
class ConsensusValidator:
    def __init__(self, max_disagreement_threshold=0.5):
        self.threshold = max_disagreement_threshold
        self.calibration_dataset = []
    
    def validate_judge_consensus(self, primary_scores: Dict, secondary_scores: Dict) -> bool:
        disagreements = []
        for criterion in primary_scores:
            diff = abs(primary_scores[criterion] - secondary_scores[criterion])
            if diff > self.threshold:
                disagreements.append((criterion, diff))
        
        if len(disagreements) > 2:  # More than 2 major disagreements
            self.trigger_human_review(disagreements)
            return False
        return True
    
    async def resolve_disagreement(self, plan_content: str, criterion: str) -> float:
        # Tie-breaker evaluation with modified prompt
        tiebreaker_prompt = self.create_focused_evaluation_prompt(criterion)
        result = await self.third_judge.evaluate(tiebreaker_prompt)
        return result.score
```

- PDF parsing fails on large or complex documents (>50MB, >1000 pages)
- Streamlit interface becomes unresponsive with real-time updates
- Memory leaks in long-running batch processing sessions

**Mitigation Strategies**:
```python
# Implementation in Phase 5
class PerformanceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pdf_size_limit = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50MB
        self.parallel_evaluation_limit = 3
        self.memory_monitor = MemoryTracker()
    
    async def optimize_evaluation_pipeline(self, plans: List[str]) -> List[Evaluation]:
        # Parallel processing with limits
        semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(self.parallel_evaluation_limit)
        
        async def evaluate_with_limit(plan):
            async with semaphore:
                return await self.evaluate_plan(plan)
        
        # Process in batches to prevent memory issues
        batch_size = 3
        results = []
        for i in range(0, len(plans), batch_size):
            batch = plans[i:i+batch_size]
            batch_results = await asyncio.gather(*[evaluate_with_limit(plan) for plan in batch])
            results.extend(batch_results)
            
            # Memory cleanup between batches
            self.memory_monitor.force_cleanup()
            
        return results
