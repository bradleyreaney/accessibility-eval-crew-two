# Data Privacy & Security Strategy - Local Development
*LLM as a Judge - Local Application Security Guidelines*

**← [Master Plan](./master-plan.md)** | **Referenced in all phases**

## Overview

This document outlines basic data privacy and security considerations for the local development version of the LLM as a Judge system. Since this application runs locally and doesn't store data persistently, security requirements are significantly simplified.

**Note**: Enterprise security features removed as this application is designed for local use only.

## Local Development Security

### Data Handling for Local Use

#### Local File Processing
- **Temporary Processing**: Files processed in memory and temporary directories
- **No Persistent Storage**: No data stored permanently on local machine
- **Session-Based**: Data exists only during active evaluation sessions
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files automatically cleaned up

#### API Key Security
- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored in local environment variables
- **No Hardcoding**: No API keys embedded in source code
- **Local .env Files**: Use .env files (git-ignored) for local development
- **Secure Transmission**: All API calls use HTTPS

### Simplified Data Classification

#### Input Data (Temporary)
- **PDF Files**: Accessibility audit reports and remediation plans
- **Processing**: Files parsed and processed in memory
- **Cleanup**: Content discarded after evaluation completion

#### Generated Data (Temporary)
- **Evaluation Results**: Judge assessments and scores
- **Reports**: Generated PDF reports
- **Export Data**: CSV/JSON exports for local download

### Local Security Implementation

```python
class LocalDataHandler:
    """
    Simple data handler for local application use
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        self.cleanup_on_exit = True
    
    def process_evaluation(self, uploaded_files):
        """
        Process uploaded files with automatic cleanup
        """
        try:
            # Process files in memory
            results = self._evaluate_files(uploaded_files)
            return results
        finally:
            # Automatic cleanup
            self._cleanup_temp_files()
```

### Basic Security Measures

#### Input Validation
- **File Type Validation**: Only accept PDF files
- **File Size Limits**: Reasonable file size restrictions
- **Content Validation**: Basic PDF structure validation

#### Error Handling
- **No Sensitive Data in Logs**: Avoid logging file contents
- **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear error messages without exposing internals
- **Graceful Failures**: Handle API failures without crashes

#### Local Environment
- **Development Only**: Not intended for production deployment
- **Single User**: Designed for individual local use
- **No Network Exposure**: Runs on localhost only

## Local Development Best Practices

### Developer Guidelines
1. **Never commit API keys** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Test with sample data** to avoid exposing real sensitive information
4. **Keep dependencies updated** for security patches

### File Handling
1. **Process files in memory** when possible
2. **Clean up temporary files** automatically
3. **Don't persist uploaded content** permanently
4. **Use secure temporary directories**

### API Integration
1. **Use HTTPS for all API calls**
2. **Implement appropriate timeouts**
3. **Handle API failures gracefully**
4. **Don't log API keys or responses**

## Local Testing Security

### Test Data Guidelines
- **Use anonymized test data** when possible
- **No real sensitive information** in test files
- **Sample accessibility reports** with fictional company data
- **Generic remediation plans** without proprietary information

### Development Environment
- **Local development only**: Not for shared environments
- **Individual API keys**: Each developer uses own API keys
- **No shared credentials**: No shared accounts or keys

---

**Security Note**: This simplified security model is appropriate for local development and testing. Any future deployment would require implementing comprehensive enterprise security measures.
        
        try:
            # Process data in secure memory space
            with SecureMemorySpace(session_id) as memory:
                parsed_audit = self._parse_in_memory(audit_data, memory)
                parsed_plans = self._parse_plans_in_memory(plans_data, memory)
                
                # Run evaluation
                result = self._evaluate_with_cleanup(parsed_audit, parsed_plans, memory)
                
                # Return sanitized result (no raw content)
                return self._sanitize_result(result)
                
        finally:
            # Guaranteed cleanup regardless of success/failure
            self._secure_cleanup(session_id)
```

#### Optional Secure Storage Mode
For organizations requiring audit trails or batch processing:

```python
class SecureStorageHandler:
    """
    Optional secure storage with encryption and access controls
    Only enabled with explicit user consent and configuration
    """
    
    def __init__(self, encryption_key: str, retention_days: int = 30):
        self.encryption = AES256Encryption(encryption_key)
        self.retention_policy = RetentionPolicy(days=retention_days)
        self.access_logger = AccessAuditLogger()
    
    def store_evaluation_data(self, data: EvaluationInput, user_consent: bool) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        Store data only with explicit user consent
        """
        if not user_consent:
            raise SecurityError("Storage requires explicit user consent")
        
        # Encrypt all sensitive data
        encrypted_data = self.encryption.encrypt_evaluation_input(data)
        
        # Store with automatic expiration
        storage_id = self._secure_store(encrypted_data)
        self.retention_policy.schedule_deletion(storage_id)
        
        # Log access for audit trail
        self.access_logger.log_storage_event(storage_id, "CREATED")
        
        return storage_id
```

## Privacy-by-Design Implementation

### 1. Data Minimization
- **Content Filtering**: Remove unnecessary metadata and personal information during parsing
- **Anonymization**: Replace organization names with generic identifiers when possible
- **Scope Limitation**: Process only accessibility-relevant content

### 2. Purpose Limitation
- **Single Use**: Data used only for stated evaluation purpose
- **No Secondary Use**: Evaluation data not used for model training or improvement
- **Clear Boundaries**: Strict separation between evaluation and system improvement data

### 3. Transparency & Control
- **Clear Consent**: Users explicitly consent to data processing methods
- **Processing Visibility**: Users can see exactly what data is being processed
- **Deletion Rights**: Users can request immediate data deletion
- **Export Rights**: Users can export their evaluation results

## Security Architecture

### API Security
```python
class APISecurityManager:
    """
    Comprehensive API security for LLM interactions
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(requests_per_minute=60)
        self.request_sanitizer = RequestSanitizer()
        self.response_filter = ResponseFilter()
    
    def secure_llm_request(self, prompt: str, context: dict) -> str:
        """
        Secure LLM API request with sanitization and filtering
        """
        # Rate limiting
        self.rate_limiter.check_and_wait()
        
        # Sanitize input
        sanitized_prompt = self.request_sanitizer.remove_sensitive_data(prompt)
        sanitized_context = self.request_sanitizer.anonymize_context(context)
        
        # Make request with timeout and retry logic
        response = self._make_secure_request(sanitized_prompt, sanitized_context)
        
        # Filter response
        filtered_response = self.response_filter.remove_potential_leaks(response)
        
        return filtered_response
    
    def _make_secure_request(self, prompt: str, context: dict) -> str:
        """
        Make LLM request with security controls
        """
        # Implement secure request logic with:
        # - TLS verification
        # - Request signing
        # - Response validation
        # - Audit logging
        pass
```

### Data Sanitization Pipeline
```python
class DataSanitizationPipeline:
    """
    Multi-stage data sanitization for privacy protection
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.pii_detector = PIIDetectionEngine()
        self.business_info_filter = BusinessInfoFilter()
        self.technical_details_filter = TechnicalDetailsFilter()
    
    def sanitize_audit_report(self, content: str) -> SanitizedContent:
        """
        Sanitize audit report content for LLM processing
        """
        sanitized = SanitizedContent(original_length=len(content))
        
        # Stage 1: Remove PII
        stage1 = self.pii_detector.detect_and_mask(content)
        sanitized.add_stage("PII_REMOVAL", stage1.changes)
        
        # Stage 2: Filter business information
        stage2 = self.business_info_filter.filter_sensitive_business_data(stage1.content)
        sanitized.add_stage("BUSINESS_INFO_FILTER", stage2.changes)
        
        # Stage 3: Technical details filtering
        stage3 = self.technical_details_filter.filter_infrastructure_details(stage2.content)
        sanitized.add_stage("TECHNICAL_FILTER", stage3.changes)
        
        sanitized.final_content = stage3.content
        sanitized.reduction_percentage = (1 - len(stage3.content) / len(content)) * 100
        
        return sanitized
```

        Securely delete file with multiple overwrite passes
        """
        # Multiple overwrite passes with random data
        for pass_num in range(3):
            with open(file_path, 'r+b') as file:
                file_size = file.seek(0, 2)
                file.seek(0)
                file.write(os.urandom(file_size))
                file.flush()
                os.fsync(file.fileno())
        
        # Remove file
        file_path.unlink()
        
        # Log secure deletion
        self.audit_logger.log_secure_deletion(str(file_path))
    
    def secure_delete_memory(self, memory_region: bytes):
        """
        Securely clear memory region
        """
        # Overwrite memory with random data
        ctypes.memset(ctypes.addressof(memory_region), 0, len(memory_region))
        
        # Force garbage collection
        gc.collect()
```
