# Enhanced Quality Gates Strategy - Local Development Focus
*Comprehensive Quality Assurance for Local LLM as a Judge Application*

## Overview

This document outlines enhanced quality gates for the local development version of the LLM as a Judge project. These quality gates focus on local functionality, testing, and reliability without production infrastructure requirements.

**Note**: Production deployment features (security, scaling, monitoring, etc.) have been removed as this application is designed for local use only.
