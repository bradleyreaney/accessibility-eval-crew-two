# Evaluation Objectivity & Golden Standard Strategy
*Ensuring Consistent and Accurate Judge Calibration*

**← [Master Plan](./master-plan.md)** | **References: [TDD Strategy](./tdd-strategy.md)**

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for ensuring evaluation objectivity through golden standard test cases, judge calibration procedures, and continuous validation mechanisms. The goal is to ensure that LLM judges provide consistent, accurate, and unbiased evaluations aligned with accessibility expertise.

## Golden Standard Test Case Framework

### Test Case Categories

#### 1. Benchmark Evaluation Sets
**Purpose**: Establish baseline performance expectations for judge accuracy

##### Set A: Expert-Validated Plans (High Quality)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] **Basic Benchmark Creation**: Create initial high/low quality test cases
- [ ] **Simple Calibration Tests**: Basic score comparison functionality
- [ ] **Performance Tracking**: Initial metrics collection system

### Phase 2: Agent Development (Week 2) 
- [ ] **Judge Calibration Integration**: Test judges against benchmarks during development
- [ ] **Baseline Performance Establishment**: Record initial calibration scores
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Test judges on challenging scenarios

### Phase 3: Workflow Integration (Week 3)
- [ ] **Real-time Monitoring**: Integrate validation into workflow
- [ ] **Performance Tracking**: Track judge performance across evaluations
- [ ] **Drift Detection**: Basic performance drift detection

### Phase 4: Interface Development (Week 4)
- [ ] **Calibration Dashboard**: UI showing judge performance metrics
- [ ] **Quality Indicators**: Display evaluation confidence in results
- [ ] **Manual Validation**: Interface for expert review when needed

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5)
- [ ] **Dynamic Recalibration**: Automatic judge recalibration system
- [ ] **Expert Integration**: Full expert validation panel integration
- [ ] **Continuous Learning**: System learns from expert feedback

## Quality Assurance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- **Judge Accuracy**: Percentage of scores within expert tolerance ranges
- **Judge Consistency**: Variation in scores for similar content
- **Bias Detection**: Systematic scoring patterns that indicate bias
- **Expert Agreement**: Level of agreement between judges and accessibility experts
- **Calibration Stability**: How well judges maintain performance over time

### Success Criteria
- Judge accuracy ≥ 85% on all benchmark test sets
- Judge consistency ≥ 90% across multiple evaluation runs
- Expert validation confidence ≥ 80% for judge evaluations
- Systematic bias ≤ 0.1 points across all evaluation criteria
- Calibration drift detected within 24 hours and corrected within 48 hours

This comprehensive evaluation objectivity strategy ensures that the LLM judges provide reliable, accurate, and consistent evaluations that align with accessibility expertise and best practices.
