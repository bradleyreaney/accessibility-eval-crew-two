            ### Executive Summary
            [High-level comparison overview and key findings]

            ### Quantitative Comparison Matrix

            - [Issues not addressed by any plan]
            - [Missing implementation details]
            - [Absent process considerations]

            #### Best Practice Opportunities
            - [Advanced techniques not used by any plan]
            - [Industry standards not referenced]
