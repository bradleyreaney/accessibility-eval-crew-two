# App Error Fixes - Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Critical AttributeError Fixed**
- **Problem**: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'`
- **Root Cause**: `st.session_state.workflow_status` was `None` when `_render_progress_monitor()` tried to call `.get()` on it
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified session state initialization to provide a proper default status dictionary instead of `None`
  - Added safety check before rendering progress monitor
  - Updated condition to use `st.session_state.get("workflow_status")` for safer access

### 2. **Deprecation Warnings Suppressed**
- **Problems**: Multiple deprecation warnings from dependencies:
  - CrewAI telemetry using deprecated `pkg_resources`
  - Pydantic V1 style configurations in CrewAI tools
  - Google Cloud namespace declarations
- **Solution**: 
  - Created centralized warning suppression utility (`src/utils/warning_suppression.py`)
  - Added targeted filters for known harmless warnings from dependencies
  - Integrated warning suppression into main app module

## Code Changes Made

### 1. **app/main.py**
```python
# Before (problematic)
if "workflow_status" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.workflow_status = None

# After (fixed)
if "workflow_status" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.workflow_status = {
        "progress": 0,
        "phase": "idle", 
        "status": "idle",
        "details": "System ready for evaluation"
    }

# Safer condition check
if st.session_state.get("workflow_status"):
    self._render_progress_monitor()
```

### 2. **src/utils/warning_suppression.py** (New File)
- Centralized warning filters for known dependency issues
- Configurable suppression that can be enabled/disabled
- Support for development mode with strict warnings

### 3. **scripts/test_app_health.py** (New File)
- Health check script to verify app components work correctly
- Tests imports, instantiation, and core module loading
- Useful for CI/CD and troubleshooting

## Test Results

✅ **All critical errors resolved**
- App imports successfully
- App instantiation works without errors  
- Streamlit server starts without AttributeError
- Progress monitoring displays safely

✅ **Warning noise reduced**
- Dependency deprecation warnings suppressed
- Clean console output during app startup
- No functional impact from remaining warnings

## Benefits

1. **Stability**: App no longer crashes with AttributeError
2. **User Experience**: Clean startup without scary warning messages
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized warning management
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks for troubleshooting

## Notes

- Deprecation warnings are from third-party dependencies (CrewAI, Pydantic, pkg_resources)
- These warnings don't affect functionality but create noise
- Warning suppression is targeted and safe - only known harmless warnings are filtered
- The app now provides better default state management for session variables

## Usage

The app should now run cleanly with:
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

For health checks, use:
```bash
python scripts/test_app_health.py
```
