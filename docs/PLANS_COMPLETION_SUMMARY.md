## 🧹 Plans Directory Cleanup

### **Plans Successfully Removed** ✅

Both completed plans have been removed from the `plans/` directory to maintain a clean and organized project structure.

**Removed Files**:
- ✅ `plans/reporting-system-enhancement-plan.md` - Completed and removed
- ✅ `plans/llm-error-handling-enhancement-plan.md` - Completed and removed

**Current Plans Directory Status**:
- **Total Plans**: 0 (All completed and removed)
- **Directory Contents**: Only `.gitkeep` file remains
- **Status**: Clean and organized

**Reason for Removal**: Completed plans no longer represent "work to be done" but rather "work completed." The features are now part of the production system and fully documented elsewhere.
