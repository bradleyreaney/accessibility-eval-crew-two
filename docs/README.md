## Documentation Philosophy

### For Human Developers
- **Comprehensive**: Complete information for understanding and implementing features
- **Practical**: Real-world examples and patterns that can be directly applied
- **Navigable**: Clear structure with cross-references and quick access to information
- **Current**: Documentation updated with code changes and maintained throughout development

### For AI Assistants
- **Contextual**: Rich context that helps AI understand project patterns and conventions
- **Structured**: Consistent formatting and organization that AI can parse effectively
- **Example-Rich**: Numerous working examples that demonstrate correct implementation patterns
- **Pattern-Based**: Clear patterns that AI can recognize and replicate appropriately

## Getting Started

### For New Developers
1. Start with `development/setup-guide.md` for environment configuration
2. Review `architecture/system-overview.md` for project understanding
3. Examine `examples/` directory for implementation patterns
4. Use `reference/evaluation-criteria.md` for evaluation framework understanding

### For AI-Assisted Development
1. Reference `development/copilot-prompts.md` for effective AI prompting
2. Use `examples/` directory for pattern recognition and code generation
3. Consult `api-reference/` for accurate API usage and specifications
4. Follow `troubleshooting/` guides for error resolution and debugging

## Documentation Standards

### Code Examples
All code examples should be:
- **Tested**: Working code that executes successfully
- **Complete**: Include necessary imports and context
- **Commented**: Clear explanations of complex logic
- **Typed**: Include type hints for better AI understanding

### Cross-References
- Use relative links to reference other documentation
- Include "See Also" sections for related information
- Reference specific implementation files when applicable
- Link to external resources and official documentation

### Update Frequency
- **Daily**: Update examples when implementation patterns change
- **Weekly**: Review and refresh troubleshooting guides
- **Phase Completion**: Comprehensive review and documentation completion
- **Production**: Final documentation validation and user guide creation

## Contributing to Documentation

### Adding New Documentation
1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Use consistent formatting and style
3. Include practical examples and code snippets
4. Test all code examples before committing
5. Add cross-references to related documentation

### Updating Existing Documentation
1. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
2. Update related documentation when making changes
3. Verify all links and references remain valid
4. Test examples to ensure they still work
5. Update timestamps and version information

## AI Assistant Integration

### GitHub Copilot Optimization
- **Consistent Patterns**: Use standardized naming and structure conventions
- **Rich Context**: Provide comprehensive docstrings and comments
